# BACKPAIN-SIMULATOR
you play as a character who breaks peoples back and get money out of it but as you progress you can do so much more, if you can play with game without laughing your not human overall the play testers said they loved this game
the motivation to make this game was because i had extream backpain and had difficulty even getting into bed so i got into my chair and got stated since i had nothing to do
