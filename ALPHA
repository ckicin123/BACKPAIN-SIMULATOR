i never uploaded the alpha of this game to github
looking back i almost don't want to because of how painful the code is
there was another version where there was some level of assci art and full data saving support but i seemingly have lost it.
not like it was high quality code anyways. i'm not going to be continuing this dead game idea but damn if it didn't teach me the point of readable code.
